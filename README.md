# Analyzing-Inpatient-medical-expense-in-US
Our goal is to analyze the inpatient expense of US medicare. We would like to explore the relations of covered rate, medicare charges, and total payments with regions, using visualization for medical charges and payments in different states from 2011 to 2017. Based on the exploratory analysis results, we will further utilize a machine learning model to predict total payments using relevant features. In addition, we are going to find and to analyze the relationship between inpatient expense and household income, inpatient expense, and life expectancy.
