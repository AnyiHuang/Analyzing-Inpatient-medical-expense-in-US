CMS is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. We are going to focus on analyzing the data 'Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Inpatient' from the year 2011 to 2017. Moreover, we collect the United state's household income by states and life expectancy by state data from the CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the United States Census Bureau. We will use the US household income from 2010 to 2017 by states and the life expectancy data including estimates of U.S. life expectancy at birth by state and census tract for the period 2010-2015. "

Based on the exploratory analysis results, we will further utilize a machine learning model to predict total payments using relevant features. In addition, we are going to find and to analyze the relationship between inpatient expense and household income, inpatient expense, and life expectancy. "
